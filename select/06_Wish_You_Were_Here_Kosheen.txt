I watched you leaving and
Never tried to get you to stay
Somehow I talked myself into
Believing that
It s just another game we play

But the moment you re gone
The heartache begins
Like an ocean of sorrow that I
Keep drowning in
Should I reach for the phone or
Wait for your call
I don t care who was wrong I
Won t go there at all

CHORUS
Oh I wish you were here
It s sometimes like these that I
Desperately need you
And I wish you were here
There s a world of love
Inside to share
I wish you were here

And the thing that keeps us
From drifting apart
Is the fact that we re bound by
The soul and the heart
Every power on earth every
Storm we ll survive
Come hell or high water love
Won t denied

CHORUS
Oh I wish you were here
It s times like these that I
Desperately need you
And I wish you were here
There s a love of love inside
Us to share
I wish you were here

Far too many nights, too
Many fights
When we should be making up
Let s get past the pride
And reach down inside for love

REPEAT CHORUS
